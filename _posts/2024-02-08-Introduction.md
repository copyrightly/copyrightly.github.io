As a math lover, I always like to solve algorithmic problems using mathematical ideas or theorems, 
or explain a perplexing algorithm through mathematical concepts. Like many other college students, 
I practiced problem solving on leetcode when I was preparing technique interviews. During the process, 
I encountered many problems having intriguing connections to what I have learnt in my college math classes. 
Some of these problems are presented as vivid examples of some abstract and confusing mathematical theorems. 
So I gradually collected problems that are more of math nature than pure CS. In this page, I categorized 
these problems based on their math nature, such as analysis, algebra, number theory, combinatorics and optimization. 
These problems make me more and more appreciate the elegance and beauty of mathematics, and sometimes surprising 
connections to algorithmic problems. So I write these articles to share my wonderful experiences with people. 
I would really appreciate it if people can provide feedback or share their collections if he/she is also a math lover.
