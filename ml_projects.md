    - [Excalidraw file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DN3LU3MbKI00udxoS-W5ckCHq99V0Uqs/view) for this video
    - Start a new conversation whenever you need, since irrlevant information in the context window is distracting (so reducing the response quality) and decreasing the responding speed
    - Pay attention to what model you're using (model providers have their own pricing tiers)
      - GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity
      - Use reasoning (thinking) models when the tasks are complicated (in particular, math and coding problems)
    - Tool use
      - Internest search (Perplexity is good at this)
      - Deep research (a combination of internet search and thinking)
      - Upload papers or books to LLM to help you read
        - A missing tool in the market: highlight a paragraph and then ask questions about it. Currently we have to copy and paste the paragraph, back and forth several times
      - Python interpreter (i.e. computer programes)
      - GPT 4o's Advanced Data Analysis (making plot, extrapolating)
      - Claude's Artifacts (e.g. make conceptual diagram of paper, chapter, book, source code, etc)
      - Cursor: Composer
    - Modalities
      - Use voice as input, it's faster than typing. Audio input(SuperWhisper, wisperFlow, MacWhisper, etc.). Audio output (usually within app)
      - Native audio input/output (Grok has more freedom than ChatGPT)
      - Podcast generation and interaction (NotebookLM)
      - Image input (see, OCR, ask about...)
      - Image output (DALL-E)
      - Video input (Advanced voice + video)
      - Video output (Sora, many many others)
    - Quality of Life features
      - ChatGPT Memory feature (save the text and always prepend it to the beginning of the prompt)
      - Custom instructions
      - Custom GPTs
- AI tools
  - [Google's Illuminate](https://illuminate.google.com/home?pli=1) which transforms text content, for example papers, into engaging audio discussions, e.g.
    - [Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762) is converted to a [4 min audio discussion](https://illuminate.google.com/home?play=SKUdNc_PPLL8)
    - [FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14135) is converted to a [6 min audio discussion](https://illuminate.google.com/library?play=qSuKlE1_qZxX1)
